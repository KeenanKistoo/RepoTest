          I am going through different blog websites and analysing how their
          wireframes/interface impacts my experience with their website. While
          doing this, I compare my ideas to the website in front of me and I
          have noticed that the majority of my wireframes are too cluttered; I
          also noticed that I am trying to put too much content on my homepage
          which takes away from the rest of the website. I do think that this
          'clutter' is down to me just playing around with CSS and figuring out
          what I can do with the programming language.

          Keeping in mind my above-mentioned challenges when designing my
          website, I found this guide/tips very helpful. One thing that I do
          believe is crucial for a website is consistency. Last year when
          designing games, I made the mistake of assuming my players (users)
          knew how everything worked so I tried to push more complex mechanics
          into my games (you can imagine how chaotic that was). I do think that
          my website needs to allow the user to find out what they need to
          without having to go through too many complex steps. It is important
          to note the difference between a design that will be considered
          'revolutionary' by the user or if it is just unnecessary.

          The programming methods and functions are similar to C# (which I have
          previously worked with), which made learning the fundamentals a lot
          easier. I do think that we have only touched on a very small portion
          of the language, and I look forward to exploring all the different
          programming possibilities.
