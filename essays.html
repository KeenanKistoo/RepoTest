          During my tertiary education experiences, I have come to the
          realisation that I take several practices, ideas, and theories for
          granted. Honestly, I do not think I have ever acknowledged a good user
          interface or commended a good experience when interacting with a
          website. However, I have always vented my frustrations when website
          interface elements were confusing.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          A website’s user interface (UI) comprises of the interactable elements
          that allow the user to navigate through the website and/or communicate
          certain information to the user. This includes, but is not limited to,
          navigation icons (hamburger button, gear cogs, etc.), search bars,
          on-screen buttons, and so on. Each website’s UI is built according to
          a certain layout.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          User Experience (UX) on the other hand, refers to the quality of the
          interaction between the UI and the user. A positive UX can be achieved
          through various concepts and ideas such as the use of familiar icons,
          responsive and efficient websites, and allowing the user to reach the
          information that they require as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Now, both of these definitions are fairly vague, however, by the end
          of this essay, I hope to explore the ideas further by analysing the
          SuperSport website (https://supersport.com/.). I have interacted with
          this website for several years, and as technology evolved, the website
          evolved with it. SuperSport is also one of the oldest sports
          broadcasting channels in South Africa and being an individual that is
          very passionate about sports, I felt it was rather fitting to discuss
          how this particular website has built its user interface to achieve a
          positive user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text"></p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          The article, The Basic Principles of User Interface Design by UXPin,
          discuss several ideas surrounding a good UX. One of them is, “placing
          the user at the centre” (UXPin, 2020). A major part of the SuperSport
          website is publishing news articles. It is important to note that,
          unlike sports-specific websites like LiveScore
          (https://www.livescore.com/en/.), or RugbyPass
          (https://www.rugbypass.com/news/.), SuperSport publishes articles,
          press conferences, highlights, results and fixtures of a variety of
          different sports. They achieve this centring of the user by displaying
          articles consistently across the UI. Each article has a title, a
          category and a timestamp which allows the user to navigate to an
          article that is relevant to them. The articles are also displayed from
          the most recent to the older articles, which ensures that the reader
          is reading relevant news.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          In the screenshot above, several UI design choices are made to display
          certain information to the user to create a positive user experience.
          In another article by UXPin, several Web Developers and Designers
          discuss aspects of good UI design (UXPin, 2021). Weber discusses
          “consistency and clarity” as two crucial elements of a good UI (UXPin,
          2021). When a mouse/trackpad cursor, hovers over an article, a shadow
          surrounds the article and the image zooms in slightly. This features
          creates a positive user experience as it clearly shows which article
          is being hovered over, however, certain faces or text may be cut out
          slightly. This is an example of good intention but could create a
          negative experience as certain players could be indistinguishable.
          Again, this is dependent on execution, if the website is tested
          efficiently by the web developers, this should not be a problem. The
          triangle pointing to the right and is surrounded by a circle or a
          ‘play button,’ communicates that there is a video or audio aspect
          involved in the article.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          In terms of consistency and clarity, the user can see where they are
          on the website. Under “Football” on the navigation tab in Annexure 1,
          the user can see a white line showing which tab they are on. This
          could be clearer if a different colour is used like the dark red in
          the SuperSport logo to keep within the colour scheme, but the user’s
          position is still being communicated. Also, the football tab is made
          up of different sections (Home, Fixtures, Results, and so on), and the
          website effectively communicates that the user is in the Home section.
          To summarise, in the image, the user is in the home section of the
          football tab. Each section, be it Rugby, Cricket, or Golf, is
          illustrated in this same way. This consistency allows the user who is
          interested in multiple sports to navigate through each sports section
          easily.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Upon searching for some of my frequently visited websites to base this
          essay on, I pushed a few to the side due to the excessive number of
          advertisements present on the websites. Advertisements play a huge
          role in negative user experience. They often draw attention away from
          the purpose of websites or delay the user from getting the necessary
          information. However, there are several ways to optimise a website to
          ensure that advertisements are not breaking the website. Google uses
          “My Ad Control” to allow users to control what ads they see and why
          through settings (Finn, 2022). Now, for many websites, this is not
          possible. Google is a major search engine that is visited frequently.
          SuperSport on the other hand is visited on a need-to-know basis. A
          user wants to know the result of a specific match, they search for
          SuperSport and navigate through the website. I do not think that web
          developers need to go to such a far extent to ensure their site is
          optimised for each user. We can work with what we know. SuperSport is
          a sports broadcasting and news website, if a user accesses this
          website, they have an interest in sports. This is already one factor
          to consider when choosing advertisements. Another process could be
          implementing surveys. Ask the user to take a survey to ensure that the
          advertisements are relevant to the user. In Annexure 1, we see that
          there is one advertisement per section. The user sees the navigation
          bar, and then an advertisement; the first set of news articles, and
          again an advertisement. This does draw the attention away from the
          website slightly, but it is not as frustrating as multiple pop-up
          advertisements that force the user to interact with them.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          The quick access bar in the footer section of the UI also creates a
          positive UX. It allows the user to access all parts of the website
          without having to click and search through each tab. It also acts as a
          summary for SuperSport as it shows all the information available on
          the website.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Small changes and elements that emphasize interface objects play a
          major role in the user experience. Highlighting selected text and
          changing the cursor from an arrow cursor to an I Beam when input is
          available or to a hand cursor when there is a link creates clear
          communication between the user and the UI. When a website is
          intuitive, it allows the user to gather the information they need
          easily
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">

        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          Another positive aspect of the UX is that the website does not force
          you to external websites for news, highlights, etc. This allows the
          user to stay in an environment where they are comfortable and that
          they trust. Videos are played from different websites like YouTube;
          however, the videos can be enjoyed within the website. This also
          encourages users to return to the website as everything that they need
          is in one place and also ties in with the ethics of interactive
          design.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          For the next part of my essay, I will be drawing on the ethical
          concerns that Peta Goldberg discusses in the Ethics Of UX Practice
          You, Your Audience And The Weight Of Experience lecture slides
          (Goldberg, 2021).
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          SuperSport gathers scores and results across several sports and
          displays them accordingly, however, the articles and interviews are
          still completed by humans. Therefore, the site uses modern technology
          to improve the efficiency in result gathering but does not eliminate
          the jobs of reporters. Was this improvement necessary? Yes. At the
          time of writing, South Africa faces several power outages (load
          shedding) daily. People who cannot afford backup power supplies such
          as inverters, generators, and so on still should be able to keep up to
          date with the sports that they are passionate about. This improvement
          in score gathering allows users to access results and commentary much
          quicker. I do not think that removing the human aspect (“deskilling”)
          from sports journalism will result in a positive user experience
          (Goldberg, 2021). Human ideas and thoughts add the edge that makes
          articles interesting for users. Similar to commentary, major sports
          commentators create a better experience for viewers.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          DS-tv broadcasts the matches that SuperSport has access to. When
          navigating through the SuperSport website, there are mentions and
          links to signing up to DS-tv and their partner, Showmax. To some
          extent, this can be viewed as “nudging,” however, it does not force
          the user to the broadcasting sites (Goldberg, 2021). It is important
          to note that the goal of the many broadcasters and/or websites, is to
          make a profit. If there are any ways that they can give the user the
          option to access their channels to make a profit without forcing the
          users to pay or provide any information, it takes the form of indirect
          advertising rather than unethical design.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          For a news website like SuperSport, the core of ethics surrounding it,
          is to upload objective articles that are well-researched and do not
          spread any false information. To ensure that this is standard
          practice, SuperSport needs to monitor the information published and
          communicate to the users if any information from previously published
          articles were incorrect. Taking accountability for mistakes or false
          information allows the website to build a good relationship with users
          and in turn create a better user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-text">
          I underestimated the amount of work and thought that went into
          designing a user interface. As an aspiring web developer, I am hoping
          that with time and experience, my website development skills will
          improve tremendously. Currently, I feel that I overdo certain aspects
          when a minimalistic display would be more effective. After going
          through several websites, I have realised that clear communication
          between the user and UI is more important than a website that is
          aesthetic with poor communication.
