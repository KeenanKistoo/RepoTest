          I have always had a passion for games; be it board games or video
          games. There is just something about it that gets my heart racing. To
          some extent, it has also provided comfort and a means to relieve
          stress, especially in the last few years. My goal is to learn the
          skills necessary to create immersive video games to provide others
          with the same sense of comfort. Games allow us to forget who we are
          for a brief period of time, and be whoever we want to be.

          In today's digital world, there is not better feeling than going onto
          a website, gathering whatever information or purchasing what you
          desire quickly and efficiently. Honestly, from a consumer perspective,
          many do not understand the amount of time and effort that goes into
          designing apps; but when a website/app crashes, everyone is
          complaining. One day I sat back and thought about how it feels to be
          on the other side as the developer. There is no sentimental back story
          to this choice, it is simply a desire to create efficient
          websites/apps to allow individuals to achieve their desired outcomes.
