          Initially, I thought this aspect would be the easiest. In my
          brainstorming notes, I mentioned desktop and mobile devices. When I
          actually researched and tried to figure out how to implement an
          effective responsive design, I was reminded of how many types of
          devices there are, from iPads to mobile phones, tablets, and so on.
          Each device has different dimensions, and my website needs to be
          adjusted according.

          The use of `rem` over `px` helps slightly as it scales the text down
          accordingly however, my navigation bar and footer are drastically
          affected by the different sizes. I have, however, changed several
          parts of my website, so before I can actually get into making these
          adjustments, I need to finalise the basic elements.

          Classes and IDs allow me to efficiently carry formatting over when I
          use DOM manipulation to display certain information. This allows me to
          create a consistent website. JavaScript (JS) also allows me to limit
          the amount of repetition in my HTML code. However, I am not as
          experienced with JS as I am with other programming languages, so it
          takes quite a lot of interpretation when going through exercises,
          tutorials, and notes.

          On a positive note, flexboxes and grids have proven extremely useful.
          Previously, I sat adjusting the padding and margins of objects by the
          decimal to ensure it is equal, however, grids allow me to do this with
          minimal code.

          Within my coding, I have tried to be more aware of the various
          semantic tags that could possibly make my website more accessible to
          all individuals. I think that it is an important factor that I have
          been made aware of.

          I have changed certain parts of my website that previously did not
          negatively affect the experience that an individual using a screen
          reader would have when using my website, but I have tried to be more
          efficient. I had previously wrapped my main body in a 'section', but
          now I have improved it to wrapping everything in a 'main' tag. I
          previously misunderstood what it meant to use the 'h1', 'h2', etc., in
          chronological order. I thought it meant for every new heading; you
          place the tag with an incremented number. I have fixed this
          accordingly in my code. I will continue to research further and learn
          the different ways of achieving a website that is accessible to all.
