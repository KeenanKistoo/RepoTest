          I wasted a lot of time wireframing the homepage to ensure it is simple
          and aesthetically pleasing. On one hand, I think it is important
          because this is the first thing a user will see when they visit my
          website but, on the other hand, my other pages lacked the same visual
          effect. There were certain JavaScript features that I was not able to
          implement in time but thankfully I made sure that the website did not
          rely on those features. I do think my time management could have been
          a bit better (I realise now that this is a standard line in several,
          if not, all my reflections).

          The website is almost fully functional. I forgot to commit a lot of
          data to GitHub. Luckily, I had no issues during this period. This was
          a good reminder that I need to get used to using GitHub. If I was
          working for a client/organisation I would have held everyone back.

          Throughout my undergraduate studies, I found that I tend to succeed in
          programming but find challenges with aesthetics. It is no different
          for this assignment. I do think that there are small improvements like
          adding a background which I would have previously just left as some
          random colour, or the icons are present instead of just plain text. I
          am trying to improve on the visual aspects where I do feel I am
          lacking. I also believe that with practice and experience, I will
          spend less time programming the basics in CSS and more time
          experimenting and making bolder choices.

          There are certain semantic tags that I do need to improve on like
          using articles instead of sections which helps users who use screen
          readers.

          I do think that I need to take more risks when making design choices.
          My designs are consistent which is good but, also very plain. It may
          serve its purpose but, a bit more interactivity and eye-catching
          features would improve the user experience.
