          I am relatively confident about my programming methods. I tried to
          follow the different semantic markups to ensure that my code makes
          sense and is accessible to screen readers.

          I do think that visually my website is not very appealing. My strength
          is generally with code, so I am not too surprised by this. I am,
          however, disappointed by this; I should have done more research on
          wireframes and designs. There was a lot of repetition within my code,
          especially in my blog section and navigation bar. This became a bit
          messy as it was difficult to find errors which also played a role in
          my lack of aesthetics due to me spending a lot of time trying to make
          sure there are no errors in my code and too little on the visual
          aspects. However, I do think that with some research and planning, I
          can improve on this aspect.

          Since this is my first submission, I am trying not to be too hard on
          myself. I know that there is a long road ahead which requires me to
          interact with my work more often, practice more and do more exploring
          within different aspects of programming. I am, thankfully, enjoying
          the technical aspects of the course and I can see myself continuing
          web design post-university.

          In this reading, we are made aware of the access, or lack of access,
          certain countries have to the internet. The statistics illustrated by
          Graham, Sabbata and Zook, not only illustrate the percentage of the
          population of each geographic area that has access to the internet but
          also how much access these geographic areas have (Graham & Sabbata &
          Zook 2015: 92). These numbers are often influenced by various factors
          such as population, government laws, the type of country (developed,
          developing or less developed), etc. For example, according to the
          statistics revealed by the World Bank, China, at the time of writing,
          has a population of about 1.4 billion people. Statistically speaking,
          China has a much higher population in comparison to other developing
          countries like South Africa, which has a population of +/- 59 million
          at the time of writing. This will drastically affect the percentage of
          internet users as South Africa's population is only around 4.2% of
          China's entire population. Even though South Africa's population is
          significantly less, its internet penetration is within in same range
          (20%-40%). More developed countries like Canada, Germany, and Sweden
          have a lower population but also a higher internet penetration (Graham
          & Sabbata & Zook 2015: 92). This also shows how less developed and
          developing countries are isolated from the world as they cannot afford
          to use the internet or do not have the available infrastructure to
          access the internet.

          Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results:

          This reading explains how information is filtered according to the
          user's location. It also describes the importance of “digital
          augmentations” (Ballatore & Graham & Sen, 2017: 1195). The information
          certain countries have available is far less than more digitally
          powerful countries. With this, the information created in less
          developing and developing countries are less likely to reach more
          developed countries.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          These two readings are related as they both discuss how less developed
          and developing countries are isolated from the digital world. Due to
          the expensive nature of the internet and how information is filtered
          according to one's location, it is easier for countries that have a
          higher internet penetration percentage in comparison to other
          countries.
