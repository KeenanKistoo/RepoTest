          I found the idea of jumping between an HTML and CSS document to be
          rather challenging at first. I made a few errors when creating classes
          and IDs which made the process a lot longer than I would have liked.
          After battling with the activity, I do think that my understanding has
          improved slightly, and I know that I need to work consistently with
          the website to fully grasp these concepts. When working with Unity and
          any other application/website really, we change fonts, font colour,
          etc. so easily. I have a new appreciation for this oddly enough, and I
          do know that there is more backend development behind what I am
          currently doing, which is something that I look to explore further
          beyond this course.

          Conventions refer to "shared practices" (Mailloux, 1983: 2). The idea
          or term that I tend to use when describing convention is mutual
          understanding. In terms of UI and UX, I have always believed that
          there are several boundaries that you need to stay within. In most
          design practices, there are always exceptions, however, it is
          important to differentiate between a bold design choice and just
          implementing something confusing and unnecessary. For example, we are
          accustomed to clicking on a 'burger icon' when looking for a menu. If
          changing this entirely and making the icon a link to the homepage
          would be confusing for users. When designing the interface for a
          website, it is important to put the website's ease of use before the
          aesthetics. When a website looks good but works poorly, users are more
          likely to close the website and find one more efficient to their
          needs.
