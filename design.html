          It took five iterations before I decided on a wireframe that best
          suited the website I was trying to create.

            This was my first iteration. Honestly, I do not know what I was
            thinking. If I remember correctly, we had just completed a
            discussion on Figma, and other wireframing tools. This was probably
            my first attempt using the tools.

            This wireframe was more aligned. This was the first iteration of my
            homepage that I actually coded. The design goal was to have all the
            information about my website present on the homepage to ensure that
            users know what they can expect.

            This is an iteration from a website that I came across when
            researching more on homepage wireframes. I decided against it as the
            "insert-quote" section was filled with sign up information on the
            website example. I felt that trying to fill my homepage with random
            words would be pointless for the user.

            This was my favourite wireframe that I have completed. It had all
            the different elements that I wanted for my homepage. For my inital
            submission (Assignment 1), I was not fully comfortable with
            HTML/CSS, so I decided against complicated things further and tried
            to keep it simple. For Assignment 3 (JavaScript submission), I
            changed my idea entirely. It will be illustrated below.

        <p class="design-text">
          In my first submission, I used very natural colours (black, white,
          beige and grey). I was struggling to match and break colours and my
          initial text was not particularly distinguishable from my backgrounds.
          Therefore, I opted for more natural tones to ensure better
          readability.

        <p class="design-text">
          The colour palette illustrates the main colour choices for my website.
          The darker blues and teal represents the types of colours that I wear.
          As I look around my room and type this, I see at least 4 out of the 6
          colours on the colour palette. I have also used shades of yellow,
          orange and red to break the monochrome look.

          There were several changes with my font and background between each
          submission. The image below, is the background image that I used
          across my website for my first submission. At the time, I thought it
          gave a paper like aesthetic but now, I think it just ostentatious and
          uneccessary. In the image it may now be the clearest however, when
          coded to cover the entire page, the texture was very overpowering.

        <p class="design-text">
          The background that you are currently looking at is a plain seashell
          tone. I felt this colour read particularly well and was not too dark
          or too bright. It also allowed for the dark teal colours to be read
          easily.

        <p class="design-text">
          The overall goal is to create a website that allows the user to easily
          navigate through. To achieve this, I would need to ensure that every
          interactive element is clearly displayed on the website, there is a
          clear loop where users can get to and from wherever they need to, and
          the website communicates to the user where they are on the website. I
          have kept a consistent navigation bar to allow users to navigate to
          and from different parts of my website easily.

          The flowchart is a very basic illustration on how a user can navigate
          through my website. It shows the continous loop between pages but also
          shows that the user can only veiw the blog posts by clicking on the
          blog section. From the blog section, the user has the option to
          navigate to any other page of the website.

          This is discussed across my design section. I tried to create a very
          simple website to ensure that my user remains in control throughout.
          In my blog section, the user has filter options which allow them to
          view only what they want to view. Since the blog section was a major
          part of this assignment, I tried my best to focus on it and throw as
          many ease of use buttons, filters, etc. as I could.

        <p class="design-text">
          I built my blog page similarly to the link above. I liked the idea of
          displaying the blog posts chronologically and with a short description
          expressing what the user is about to read. I initially had a grid with
          all my blog posts, but when asking people to navigate through my
          website, there were quite a few misunderstandings where users read
          certain aspects in the wrong order. For the future though, I do think
          I can incorporate certain filtering buttons that allow people to view
          the website in different ways.
