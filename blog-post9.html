          I made an error with my submission which led to me failing my
          assignment. It was careless on my part and there really is not a
          bright side to look at, but I now need to work ten times more
          efficiently to ensure that I recover from this.

          I have spent several hours researching and going through lecture
          activities to identify ways to make my website more efficient. The
          first task that I assigned to myself was to identify an effective way
          to distribute my navigation bar across each page without copying and
          pasting the HTML. I have decided to use the onload event to carry my
          nav bar across each page. I found this to be the most efficient
          solution.

          Reading: The Road to Technocolonialism - Giorgos Verdi

          “Technocolonialism” refers to the process of powerful technological
          countries and companies who use their resources and advancements to
          gain power and control over countries (Verdi, 2020). The USA and China
          have already begun distributing their resources to Southern African
          countries (Verdi, 2020).

          South Africa is a developing country with a high unemployment rate.
          Yes, artificial intelligence will not only create a more efficient
          economy but will also reduce/remove the factor of human error. Now,
          the main question is: Will this actually be beneficial in a developing
          country like South Africa? Personally, being someone who has access to
          technology, and would like to believe they are technologically
          efficient, I do see the benefits. For example, many, if not all, South
          African citizens have experienced standing in line with countless
          individuals; be it home affairs, or licencing departments. The systems
          are not efficient enough to handle so many people every single day. So
          yes, the improvement that AI would provide would obviously be helpful
          however, I do believe that it is important that the technological
          advancements that are put in place to control sensitive information
          such as identification numbers, passport numbers, etc. should be
          developed within our country. Firstly, this creates job opportunities
          for the citizens of South Africa and secondly, if the information is
          leaked, or handled incorrectly, the country will be able to find out
          how, why and to what extent the information was leaked or mishandled.
          Realistically speaking, if we put the power of information handling in
          the hands of these powerful countries, we cannot hold them accountable
          for mishandling it. Our country does not have the military
          capabilities to go up against these countries nor do we have the
          technological advancements to protect ourselves as they will have all
          the power. By placing them in control of our data and infrastructure
          we are only giving them more power over us.

          At a more elementary level, with the high unemployment rates, we
          cannot afford to replace more citizens with AI. This will drastically
          affect our economy in the long run as we will have several individuals
          within certain job sectors who are unemployed. To develop more as a
          country, we cannot try to take shortcuts or sign contracts that we are
          not in full control of. Several parts of Africa are still recovering
          from the effects of The Scramble for Africa (colonialism). During that
          era, we did not have a say, and the land was just taken aggressively,
          however, in the current era, we have the ability to at least resist
          these powerful countries.
