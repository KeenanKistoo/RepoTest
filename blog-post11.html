          I am coming towards a point where I am ready to implement the
          different JS functions however, I am not entirely comfortable with
          certain syntax and functions yet. This limits what I can do as I find
          myself using the backticks/grave accents (``) more often than I would
          like to. I have decided to use this for my navigation bar, footer, and
          blog post generator; and all the other JS implementations to be done
          with DOM manipulation. This decision is solely based on the importance
          of these three parts. If they do not function properly, the user will
          not be able to navigate through my website.

          Reflection on Travelling While Trans - Sasha Costanza-Chock

          This article discusses the author’s experience when going through the
          airport wave scanning machine. A particular reference in the article
          that highlights the severity of the lack of inclusive technology would
          be when the author mentions how sure that they will be “uncomfortable,
          embarrassed, humiliated” (Constanza-Chock, 2020: 3). An individual who
          is not breaking any rules (such as carrying drugs, illegal weapons,
          etc.) should not feel uncomfortable when approaching these sort of
          mandatory checks.

          There are several ways to avoid a situation like this which are also
          discussed in different parts of The Design Justice Network
          (Constanza-Chock, 2020: 6). However, I do think that to some extent it
          boils down to educating individuals about issues that these
          marginalised groups face in their daily lives. By educating
          individuals consistently, they will be able to approach the situation
          more respectfully. Yes, several designs and procedures are not
          inclusive enough but, it will be counterproductive to only improve how
          technology and algorithms are designed without educating the
          individuals who control/oversee the use of this technology.
        </p>

          Finally, marginalised groups should be in control or constantly
          oversee improvements to the technology as the author discusses
          (Constanza-Chock, 2020: 6). I, as an Indian male, have the ability to
          program certain things like games and websites, however, I do not bear
          the same experiences as individuals like the author; therefore, I
          cannot effectively program something that will directly influence
          certain groups without a discussion and constant feedback. Naturally,
          the solution would be effective communication and constant
          improvements to not only include some marginalised groups but all.
